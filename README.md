## About

User Monkey is a plug-and-play complete user-management system written in PHP and bundled into a single file. It enables you to easily add support for features where user sign up is required, such as posts/ comments, paywalled content, saving preferences, spam reduction, etc. All the commonly required features are included as standard and there's also an optional UI.

#### Features

- Registration
- Log in / Log out
- Account Deletion
- Password Resets
- Account Verification
- Editing Account Info
- Link Social Media Accounts
- Gravatar Picture Support

There's also an optional UI, which includes the screens for all the above opperations (registration, authentication, profile page, account settings, etc)

#### Demo
~A live demo of the running project can be viewed at: [code.as93.net/user-monkey](https://web.archive.org/web/20150809214155/http://code.as93.net/user-monkey/)~ (demo no longer available)

#### Project Update
This app was developed in 2010-12, and used across several of my apps, and other peoples projects for almost 10 years after. It served it's purpose as a simple single-file user-management system, but times have moved on, and there are now some much better alternatives out there. I strongly recommend against using this project in any production application.

#### Alternatives
If your looking for a PHP-based user management system, I'd recomend either [UserFrosting](https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting) or [UserSpice](https://userspice.com/). Both are widley used, fully tested, clearly documented and serve their purpose well.

## Usage

### Getting Started

```php
/* First start a session, if not already started */
if(session_id() == '') { session_start(); } 

/* Next include the PHP classes (see demo folder for Db class)*/
include_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/user-monkey/php/Db.class.php";         // Database Class
include_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/user-monkey/php/UserActions.class.php";// User Actions Class

/* Connect to the database */
$db = new Db();
$db->connect();

/* Create an instance of the UserActions class */
$ua = new UserActions();
```
	

### Register New User

```php
$register = new Register(); 
$success = $register->registerUser($username,$email,$password,"standard"); 
```

### Log In User

```php
$logIn = new Login();
$success = $logIn->start($username, $password);
```
	
### Log Out
```php
$ua = new UserActions();
$ua->logOut();
```	
	
### Reset Password
```php
$settings = new UserActions();
$success = $settings->resetPassword($userId, $password);
```
	
### Change Users Email Address
```php
$settings = new UserSettings();
$success = $settings->changeEmail($userId, $password,  $email);
```
	
### Change Users Password
```php
$settings = new UserSettings();
$success = $settings->changeUsername($userId, $password,  $username);
```	
	
### Delete Users Account
```php
$settings = new UserSettings();
$success = $settings->deleteAccount($userId, $password);
```
	
### Send Activation Email
```php
$activationObject = new VerifyAccount($userId);
$activationObject->setUrl("http://example.com");
$activationObject->sendActivationEmail();
```	
	
### Verify Users Account
```php
$act = new VerifyAccount($userId);
$success = $act->attemptActivate($code);
```

If `$success` is false, then the `$object->getMessage();` method can be called that will return a short string informing why the action could not be completed (e.g. _"Unable to create account - username already taken"_). For example:

```php	
$register = new Register(); 
$success = $register->registerUser($username,$email,$password,"standard"); 
if(!$success){
  echo $register->getMessage();
}
```

## Frontend

There is an optional UI included (see [source](https://github.com/Lissy93/usermonkey/tree/master/DEMO/user-monkey)). It's themable, but here's some screenshots of it running...
